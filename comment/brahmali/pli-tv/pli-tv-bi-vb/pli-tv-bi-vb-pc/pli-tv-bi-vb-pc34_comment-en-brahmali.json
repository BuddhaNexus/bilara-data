  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pc34:2.1.14": "_Antevāsinī_. I normally translate this as “student”, but here I need to distinguish it from _sahajīvinī_ and _saddhivihārinī_ mentioned above. From {MS.3.271} and {MS.3.319} it seems the _saddhivihārī/saddhivihārinī_ is normally the student of a preceptor (_upajjhāya/pavattinī_), whereas the _antevāsī/antevāsinī_ is a student of a teacher _ācariya/ācarinī_. Where the context makes no special demands, I translate both terms as “student.”"
