  "pli-tv-kd13:23.5.2": "It is not clear from the Pali whether the knowing concerns the offense or the concealing. Further on, however, it is said that ‘He deserves the trial period for the one offense only.’ This indicates that the knowing concerns the offense. If the knowing had concerned only the concealing, he would have had to do the trial period (_mānatta_) for both offenses. This means the phrase _jānappaṭicchannā_ must be understood as “concealed knowingly”, where the “knowing” refers back to the offense. The same argment holds for the next two cases, which involve not remembering an offense and being unsure of an offense.",
  "pli-tv-kd13:28.1.1": "“Specified” renders _parimāṇā_, literally “limited”. {Sp.4.165}: _Tattha ‘antarā sambahulā āpattiyo āpajjati parimāṇā appaṭicchannāyo’tiādīsu āpattiparicchedavasena parimāṇāyo ceva appaṭicchannāyo cāti attho_, “Here the meaning of _antarā sambahulā āpattiyo āpajjati parimāṇā appaṭicchannāyo_, etc. is that it is specified and unconcealed on account of the offense being delimited.”",
  "pli-tv-kd13:33.1.8": "“Of the same sort” renders _vavatthitā_, while “of various sorts” renders _sambhinnā_. {Sp.4.180}: _Vavatthitā sambhinnāti sabhāgavisabhāgānamevetaṃ pariyāyavacanaṃ_, “‘Of the same sort’ and ‘of various sorts’ are synonymous with ‘of one kind’ and ‘of different kinds’.”",
  "pli-tv-kd13:34.1.12": "_Missakadiṭṭhino_, literally, “They see (it) as mixed”. {Sp.4.181}: _Tattha missakanti thullaccayādīhi missakaṃ_, “Therein ‘mixed’ means mixed with serious offenses, etc.”"
