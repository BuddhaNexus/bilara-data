  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.3.12": "I have here translated _kāya_ as breath in accordance with the usage in the Ānāpānasati Sutta [](MN 118.24) where the breath is specifically said to be a body among bodies. This is also the commentarial explanation: “He trains, ‘I will breath in,’ producing knowledge of and familiarity with the beginning, the middle, and the end of the whole body of the breath.” (_Sakalassa assāsakāyassa ādimajjhapariyosānaṃ viditaṃ karonto pākaṭaṃ karonto “assasissāmī”ti sikkhati_; [](Sp.2.411.2).)",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.4.2": "“For a certain event” is not found in the Pali, but has been added to make the Pali idiom clearer.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.13.1": "The Pali seem to say that he simply fell off the cliff, _papatanto_, but the context seems to require something more deliberate. Perhaps it is just an idiom.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.18.22": "It is not an offense entailing expulsion because he was aiming to kill the child, not the mother.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.23.1": "The text doesn’t say what the procedure, the _saṅghakamma_, was about, but it seems implied that it was against that monk. This is also the position of the subcommentary: “Aiming at a procedure: aiming at doing a procedure of censure, etc.” (_Kammādhippāyāti: tajjanīyādikammakaraṇādhippāyā_; [](Sp-ṭ.2.187).) The monks from the group of seventeen were in regular conflict with the monks from the group of six."
