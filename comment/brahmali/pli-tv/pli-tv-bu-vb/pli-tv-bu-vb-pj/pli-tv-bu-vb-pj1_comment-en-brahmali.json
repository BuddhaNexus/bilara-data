  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.1.18": "I have supplied “the problems of famine” from the commentary (_dubbhikkhe dullabhapiṇḍe imāya sallahukavuttitāya iminā ca sallekhena vijitaṃ_), [](Sp.1.180.24), to bring out the meaning.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:8.2.41": "I have added two sets of ellipses points that seem to be missing from the Pali of MS.1.92. The missing sets are between “he says and declares: ‘Why don’t I renounce my fellow monks?’” and “he says and declares: ‘Why don’t I become a lay person?’” and between “he says and declares: ‘Why don’t I become a lay person?’” and “‘Why don’t I become a lay follower?’”",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:9.3.2": "That is, he agrees to the sexual intercourse at this point.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:9.7.7": "In Permutations part 1 above _magga_ is translated as “orifice,” here as “private part.” This follows from what appears to be a slightly different usage in the two sections. In the previous section _magga_ refers to the three orifices of the partner that a monk might have sexual intercourse with. In this section _magga_ seems to refer specifically to the genitals and the anus, whether of the partner or the monk, and the mouth would seem to be excluded. The mouth here seems to be represented by the Pali _amagga_, “non-path” or “non-private part.” This follows from the fact that in the _vinaya_ the anus is regularly called _vaccamagga_, “the path of feces,” and the genitals _passāvamagga_, “the path of urine.” The mouth, however, with the curious exception of the previous section, is never called _magga_. In this interpretation I follow BMC I, p.45.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.17.2": "_Aṅgamaṅgāni_, “various bodily parts.” The point seems to be that the wind element caused stiffness throughout the body."
