  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:2.14": "“Taking up” here renders both _samādāya_ and _paggayha_, and as a consequence it appears as if one of the definitions found in the Pali is missing in the translation. In the Pali _samādāya_ is defined as _ādāya_, “having adopted,” and _paggayha_ as _dīpeyya_, “he proclaims.”"
