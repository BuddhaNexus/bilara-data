  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss3:2.7": "I have rendered _otiṇṇo vipariṇatena cittena_ with the single word “lustful.” This means that the definition for _vipariṇataṃ_ is missing from my translation. Here is the Pali, followed by a translation: _Vipariṇatanti rattampi cittaṃ vipariṇataṃ. Duṭṭhampi cittaṃ vipariṇataṃ. Mūḷhampi cittaṃ vipariṇataṃ. Api ca rattaṃ cittaṃ imasmiṃ atthe adhippetaṃ vipariṇatanti_; “distorted: a mind with desire is distorted, a mind with anger is distorted, a confused mind is distorted. But in this case ‘distorted’ refers to a mind with desire.”"
