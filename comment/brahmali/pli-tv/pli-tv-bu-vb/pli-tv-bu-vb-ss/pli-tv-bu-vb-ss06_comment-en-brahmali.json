  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.6.6": "That is, twelve _sugata-vidatthis_ long and seven _sugata-vidatthis_ wide inside. A _vidatthi_ is often translated as a hand-span. _Sugata_ is an epithet of the Buddha, but in this context it is used to designate a standard measure, “the standard hand-span.” [](Sp.1.348) says: _Sugatavidatthi nāma idāni majjhimassa purisassa tisso vidatthiyo_, “Here the _sugata vidatthi_ is equal to three _vidatthis_ of an average man.” This does not need to be understood as the Buddha being three times the size of an ordinary person, but just that the standard hand-span is three times the regular length. For the conversion into metric units I nevertheless follow the estimate of the _sugata-vidatthi_ in BMC, pp.565-566. For an explanation of the rendering “sponsoring owner,” see note to the following rule, [](MS.1.1515)."
