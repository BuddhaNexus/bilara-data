  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np29:2.7": "The text reads “five hundred bow-lengths,” _pañcadhanusatikaṃ_. According to [](Sp-ṭ.2.92): “A measure of nine hand-spans of an ordinary hand, or a measure of four fore-arms when the bowstring is attached, this is called the teacher’s bow length,” _ācariyadhanu nāma pakatihatthena navavidatthippamāṇaṃ, jiyāya pana āropitāya catuhatthappamāṇa_. The teacher’s bow-length is the standard measure for bow-lengths, see [](Sp. 2.301.15). Given the estimate of 50 cm for one forearm (a _hattha_, sometimes translated as “cubit”) in BMC I, pp. 565-566, five hundred bow-lengths add up to about one kilometer."
