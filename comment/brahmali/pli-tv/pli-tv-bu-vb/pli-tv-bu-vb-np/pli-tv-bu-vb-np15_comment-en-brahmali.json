  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.3.10": "That is, one _sugata-vidatthi_, “one _sugata_ hand-span.” _Sugata_ is an epithet of the Buddha, but in this context it is used to designate a standard measure, “the standard hand-span.” For the conversion into metric units, I follow the estimate of the _sugata-vidatthi_ given in BMC I, pp.565-566. _Purāṇasanthatassa sāmantā sugatavidatthi_, “a piece of 25 centimeters from the border of an old blanket.” This is based on the analysis and translation in TAP, p.140. [](Sp.1.567) seems to support this: _Sāmantāti ekapassato vaṭṭaṃ vā caturassaṃ vā chinditvā gahitaṭṭhānaṃ yathā vidatthimattaṃ hoti, evaṃ gahetabbaṃ_, “_Sāmantā_ means: having cut a circle or a square from one side, at the place where it is taken, a measure of one hand-span is to be taken.”"
