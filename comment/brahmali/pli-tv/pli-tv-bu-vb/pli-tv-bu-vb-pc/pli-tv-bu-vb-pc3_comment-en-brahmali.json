  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc3:1.21": "This is translated somewhat freely in accordance with the explanation below and in the commentary. According to [](MS.2.144) (see below) the offense is only incurred when a monk brings the words of another monk to the attention of yet another monk, and thus the translation “between monks.” [](Sp.4.740.20) supports the plural rendering “monks”: “malicious talebearing of monks,” _bhikkhūnaṃ pesuññe_.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc3:2.2.72": "I have added the ellipses points, which are presumably missing in the original due to an editing mistake, cf.[](MS.2.138) above. The same is true of [](MS.2.142) below.",
