The same method applies for one who is coming. After going, even when returning, he may eat one day on the road and one day at the place returned to.” _Gacchanto vāti yo gacchanto antarāmagge ekadivasaṃ gataṭṭhāne ca ekadivasaṃ bhuñjati, tassāpi anāpatti. Āgacchantepi eseva nayo. Gantvā paccāgacchantopi antarāmagge ekadivasaṃ āgataṭṭhāne ca ekadivasaṃ bhuñjituṃ labhati._"
