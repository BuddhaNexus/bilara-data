  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.1.5": "I have rendered _muñja_-reed and _pabbaja_-reed with the single word “reed”. I am not aware that these two kinds of reed can be distinguished in English.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.6.6.1": "",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:3.16.3": "The term _guhā_ does not have a precise equivalent in English. The general meaning seems to be “enclosed place” or “hiding place”, derived from the root _guh_, meaning “to cover” or “to hide”. In the Vinaya Piṭaka such places are either naturally occurring, as in _giriguhā_ [](pli-tv-kd16:1.1.4), or man-made [](pli-tv-kd3:5.5.8). But in most cases, probably all cases, a _guhā_ was used to shelter or cover something. It was used, for instance, to shelter food from the rain [](pli-tv-kd6:33.2.1), to store robes from destruction by insects [](pli-tv-kd8:7.1.3), and to shelter monks while doing the _uposatha_ ceremony [](pli-tv-kd2:8.1.7). Further details are found in the commentaries, e.g. at [Sp.4.294](): _Guhāti iṭṭhakāguhā silāguhā dāruguhā paṁsuguhā_, “_Guhā_: a _guhā_ made of bricks, a _guhā_ made of rocks, a _guhā_ made of wood, a _guhā_ made of dirt.” And at [Sp.ṭ.3.294](): _Giriguhā nāma dvinnaṁ pabbatānaṁ antarā, ekasmiṁyeva vā umaṅgasadisaṁ mahāvivaraṁ_, “_Giriguha_: in the middle of two hills or a great opening like a tunnel in just one (of them).” In sum, it is likely that “cave” does not properly capture all nuances of _guhā_, but in the absence of a more fitting term, it is perhaps satisfactory."
