  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:0.6": "Here, and in the heading to _bhikkhu nissaggiya pācittiya 3_ (and also at the end of each of these rules), I translate _kathina_ as “robe-making season” rather than “robe-making ceremony”, since this is the contextual meaning in these rules.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:2.17.1": "In addition to meaning a finished robe, according to the definition of _cīvara_ below it also refers to pieces of robe-cloth. This means that I have to vary my translation depending on the context.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:3.1.2": "This refers to the robe-cloth received during the robe-making season. For details see [](pli-tv-kd7:1.7.4-pli-tv-kd7:12.1.37).",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:3.1.4": "For an explanation of this see [](pli-tv-kd7:1.7.3) and [](pli-tv-kd7:1.7.4-pli-tv-kd7:12.1.37).",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:3.1.8": "“Transferred” renders _vikappita_/_vikappanā_, sometimes translated as “shared ownership”. There is little evidence, however, for this latter rendering, and the Canon clearly supports the former. In the main rule that deals with _vikappanā_, _bhikkhu-pācittiya_ 59, it is described as follows: “I give (_dammi_) this robe-cloth to you for the purpose of _vikappanā_” and “I give it to them (_dammi)”. And once the cloth has been transferred, it is called “their property” (_tesaṁ santakaṁ_). It is clear from this that _vikappanā_ refers to a change in ownership. This finding is reinforced by the usage of _vikappanā_ in _bhikkhu-pācittiya_ 33. The Buddha tells Ven. Ānanda to _vikappeti_ a meal in the following way: “I give (_dammi_) my expected meal to so-and-so.” In the context of this rule _vikappeti_ can only mean “to transfer ownership”, not “to share ownership”. Sometimes _vikappanā_ is rendered simply as “transfer”. But since it only concerns a transfer of ownership, not necessarily a physical transfer, it could also be rendered “transfer of ownership”, although this latter expression is a bit clumsy in most contexts.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:3.1.10": "The six are linen, cotton, silk, wool, sunn hemp, and hemp, see [](pli-tv-kd8:3.1.6). | According to [](pli-tv-kd8:21.1.4) this is no smaller than 8 by 4 _sugataṅgula_, “standard fingerbreadths”. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:3.2.2": "According to [Sp.1.462]() this means the tenth dawn after one received the robe(-cloth)."
