  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc59:1.13.1": "“Transfers ownership of” renders _vikappeti_/_vikappanā_, sometimes translated as “shared ownership”. There is little evidence, however, for this latter rendering, and the Canon clearly supports the former. In the main rule that deals with _vikappanā_, _bhikkhu-pācittiya_ 59, it is described as follows: “I give (_dammi_) this robe-cloth to you for the purpose of _vikappanā_” and “I give it to them (_dammi)”. And once the cloth has been transferred, it is called “their property” (_tesaṁ santakaṁ_). It is clear from this that _vikappanā_ refers to a change in ownership. This finding is reinforced by the usage of _vikappanā_ in _bhikkhu-pācittiya_ 33. The Buddha tells Ven. Ānanda to _vikappeti_ a meal in the following way: “I give (_dammi_) my expected meal to so-and-so.” In the context of this rule _vikappeti_ can only mean “to transfer ownership”, not “to share ownership”. Sometimes _vikappanā_ is rendered simply as “transfer”. But since it only concerns a transfer of ownership, not necessarily a physical transfer, the full expression “transfer of ownership” seems preferable.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc59:2.1.18": "The six are linen, cotton, silk, wool, sunn hemp, and hemp; see [](pli-tv-kd8:3.1.6). | According to [](pli-tv-kd8:21.1.4) this is no smaller than 8 by 4 _sugataṅgula_, “standard fingerbreadths”. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc59:2.2.3": "The Pali here reads _appaccuddhāraṇasaññī_ , which must be an editing mistake. I instead follow the PTS reading, _paccuddhāraṇasaññī_."
