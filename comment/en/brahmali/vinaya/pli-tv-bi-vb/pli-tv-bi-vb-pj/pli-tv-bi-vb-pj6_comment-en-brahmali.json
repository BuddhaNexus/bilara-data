  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:1.23.1": "“Community” renders _gaṇa_, normally translated as \"group\". Whenever a monastic is obliged to inform of another's offence, the informing happens either to an individual or to a Sangha. In fact, the word _gaṇa_ is occasionally used to refer to a Sangha, such as: (1) _Na, bhikkhave, ūnadasavaggena gaṇena upasampādetabbo_ “You should not give the full ordination in groups of less than ten” (Kd.1.31.2.3) \n",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.6": "“She has told her” presumably means that the nun who has committed the offense has spoken about it.",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.14": "_Saliṅge ṭhitā vuccati_. This is explained in the sub-commentary ([Vin-vn-ṭ.1989]()) as: _saliṅge tu ṭhitāyāti pabbajjāliṅgeyeva ṭhitāya_, “For one remaining in the characteristic means: for one remaining in the characteristic of being gone forth.”"
