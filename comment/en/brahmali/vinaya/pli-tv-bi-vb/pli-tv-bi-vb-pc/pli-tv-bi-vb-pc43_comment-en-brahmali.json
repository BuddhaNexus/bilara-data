  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pc43:2.1.7": "[Sp.1.636](): _Sāṇanti sāṇavākasuttaṁ. Bhaṅganti pāṭekkaṁ vākasuttamevāti eke. Etehi pañcahi missetvā katasuttaṁ pana “bhaṅga”nti veditabbaṁ_, “_Sāṇa_: thread from the bark of hemp. _Bhaṅga_: some say it is just a separate thread from bark. But _bhaṅga_ is to be understood as the thread made by mixing the (other) five.”\n\nSED says: “_śaṇa_, m. L also n.) a kind of hemp, Cannabis Sativa or Crotolaria Juncea …”\nAnd: “_bhāṅga_, mf(_ī_)n, (fr. _bhaṅgā_) hempen, made or consisting of hemp …” and “Bhaṅgā, f. hemp (Cannabis Sativa); an intoxicating beverage (or narcotic drug commonly called ‘bhang’) prepared from the hemp plant”.\n\n_Cannabis Sativa_ is “hemp”, whereas _Crotolaria Juncea_ is often known as “sunn hemp”, according to Wikipedia. I translate the two Pali terms accordingly.\n"
