This is based on the commentary to _bhikkhu pācittiya_ 10, [Sp.2.86](): _Sakiṃ āṇatto bahukampi khaṇatīti sacepi sakaladivasaṃ khaṇati, āṇāpakassa ekaṃyeva pācittiyaṃ_, “_Sakiṃ āṇatto bahukampi khaṇatīti_: there is only one offense entailing confession for the one who asks, even if the other digs the entire day.” "
