  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pc59:1.11.1": "“Should question” renders _paccāsīsitabbā_. The verb _paccāsiṁsati_ means “to expect” or “to seek” something from someone, with the commentary glossing it as _icchitabbā_, “to be desired”, at [Sp.2.149](). If one renders this directly as “the nuns should expect two things from the Sangha of monks”, then it would seem as if the monks are to enquire from and approach the nuns, which is the opposite of the required meaning. Thus my non-literal rendering. "
