  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:1.5": "In the sequence _uññāya paribhavena akkhantiyā vebhassiyā dubbalyā_ every word seems to be in the instrumental case except _dubbalyā_, which is odd. The commentary, at [Sp.2.727](), says: _Dubbalyāti tumhākaṃ dubbalabhāvena_, “_Dubbalyā_: because of your weakness.” This implies that _dubbalyā_ is the only word in the sequence that does not refer to the Sangha, which is also odd. Since _dubbalyā_ is part of a sequence of words, all of which would seem to refer to the same thing, that is the Sangha, it is possible that _dubbalyā_ should be regarded as a rare instrumental in _ā_. I read it as such. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.77": "_Ñattiyā dukkaṭaṁ_. The Pali text just says _dukkaṭa_, without specifying that it is an _āpatti_, an offense. Yet just below the text says that the _dukkaṭa_ is annulled if you commit the full offense of _saṅghādisesa_. The implication is that _dukkaṭa_ should be read as _āpatti dukkaṭassa_, “an offense of wrong conduct”.",
