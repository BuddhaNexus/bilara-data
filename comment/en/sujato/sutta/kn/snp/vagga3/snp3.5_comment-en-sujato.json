  "snp3.5:23.4": "segment",
  "snp3.5:24.1": "The “speaker’s mark” is in MS treated as part of the line, which is unusual if not unique. According to Norman’s note here however, we should consider this line a seven-syllable sloka (perhaps restoring the variant _ca_ to make it eight). ",
  "snp3.5:26.1": "_Bajjhati_ seems odd to me, and I wonder if it is an old mistake for _bujjhati_. However _bajjhati_ is recognized in the commentary."
