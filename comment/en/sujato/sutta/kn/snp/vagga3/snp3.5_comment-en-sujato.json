  "snp3.5:5.5": "Bodhi translates _ārādhaye_ as simple present tense here (“succeeds”) and in the identical line below as imperative (“should accomplish”). Norman has the optative mood in both cases, which is surely correct.",
  "snp3.5:23.4": "segment",
  "snp3.5:24.1": "The “speaker’s mark” is in MS treated as part of the line, which is unusual if not unique. According to Norman’s note here however, we should consider this line a seven-syllable sloka (perhaps restoring the variant _ca_ to make it eight). ",
  "snp3.5:26.1": "_Bajjhati_ (“bound”) seems odd to me in this line. If it stands, the Buddha does not actually answer the question, since he only discusses the positive side. PTS notes a reading _bujjhati_ in the commentary, which I follow. However the commentary reads _bajjhati_ in the VRI edition, and the comment supports this, since it treats it as a bad thing. If it is a mistake, then, it is an old one."
