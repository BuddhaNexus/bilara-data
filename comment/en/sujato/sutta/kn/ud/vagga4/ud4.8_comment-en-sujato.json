  "ud4.8:2.2": "Anandajoti has “venture”, Thanissaro has “dare”, but a similar phrase at pli-tv-kd8:12.1.5 clearly has the less pregnant sense of “able”, per Ireland. Comm: ussahasīti sakkosi",
  "ud4.8:2.4": "Accepting the variant, which is found in all similar passages. Reading, as Thanissaro and Anandajoti do, “what can I *not* do” is pleasingly dramatic, but not very idiomatic for Pali. Far more likely a simple reinforcement is meant. Comm ignores, implying it thought there was nothing to see.",
  "ud4.8:5.1": "All the translations I have consulted (Masefield, Ireland, Thanissaro, and Anandajoti) have some variant of “stirred up people’s indignation”, evidently reading _manusse_ as nominative (?) But it must be accusative plural, which is the regular form in such constructions, eg. pli-tv-bu-vb-pc13:3.2.1 _anupasampannaṁ ujjhāpeti_ “complains to one not fully ordained”."
