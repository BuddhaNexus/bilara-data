  "sa35.7:2.1" : "It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, ",
  "sa35.7:2.2" : "“What is it that exists, that arises, that ties, that’s an attachment, and that’s viewed as self and causes grief, sorrow, vexation, and pain that have yet to arise to arise and grief, sorrow, vexation, and pain that have arisen to deepen and increase?” ",

  "sa35.7:3.4" : "After they hear it, the monks will accept and hand it down.” ",
  "sa35.7:4.1" : "The Buddha addressed the monks, ",
  "sa35.7:4.2" : "“It’s because form exists, because form arises, because form ties and becomes an attachment that form is viewed as self. ",

  "sa35.7:9.1" : "“So it is, monks. ",
  "sa35.7:9.2" : "If something is impermanent, then it’s painful. ",
  "sa35.7:9.3" : "Because this pain exists, these things arise, tie, become attachments, and are viewed as self. ",
  "sa35.7:9.4" : "Grief, sorrow, vexation, and pain that have yet to arise are made to arise, and grief, sorrow, vexation, and pain that have arisen are deepened and increased. ",

  "sa35.7:12.1" : "“If someone’s view is that there’s a self, a world, or this and another world that are permanent, eternal, and unchanging, all these are not self or different than self, and [the two] are not present in each other. ",
  "sa35.7:12.2" : "This is called right wisdom. ",
  "sa35.7:13.1" : "“Again, if someone’s view is that it’s not this world that’s self or self-possessed and not the future that’s self or self-possessed, all these are not self or different than self, and [the two] are not present in each other. ",
