  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:6.1": "At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:6.2": "At that time Migāra’s grandson Sāḷha wanted to build a dwelling for the Order of nuns.",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:6.3": "He went to the nuns and said,",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:6.4": "“Venerables, I wish to build a dwelling for the Order of nuns.",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:6.5": "Please give me the nun in charge of building work.”",

  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:6.8": "Of these, the nun Sundarīnandā had gone forth when she was young, and she was beautiful, intelligent, skilled, and diligent, and she possessed good judgment in regard to doing and arranging things well.",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:6.9": "After appointing Sundarīnandā to be in charge of building work, the Order of nuns made her work with Sāḷha.",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:6.10": "As a consequence of this, Sundarīnandā would often go to Sāḷha’s house to ask for tools:",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:6.11": "“Give a adze, give a hatchet, give an axe, give a spade, give a chisel.”",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:6.12": "And Sāḷha would often go to the nuns’ dwelling place to find out about the progress of the building work.",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:6.13": "And because they saw each other frequently, they fell in love.",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:7.1": "Then, because he could not find an opportunity to be intimate with Sundarīnandā, Sāḷha invited the Order of nuns for a meal.",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:7.2": "While preparing the seats in the dining hall, he counted the number of nuns senior to Venerable Sundarīnandā and placed their seats to one side, and he counted the number of nuns junior to her and placed their seat on the other side.",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:7.5": "He then placed Sundarīnandā’s seat in a concealed spot in a corner, with the idea that the senior nuns would think she was seated close to the junior ones and the junior nuns would think she was seated close to the senior ones.",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:7.9": "Soon afterwards he informed the Order that the meal was ready.",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:7.11": "Sundarīnandā thought, “Sāḷha hasn’t prepared a meal for the Order of nuns as a service, but because he wants to be intimate with me.",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:7.14": "She then told a nun who was her pupil, “Go and bring back almsfood for me.",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:7.16": "If anyone asks about me, let them know I’m sick.”",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:7.17": "“Yes, Venerable,” she replied.",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:8.1": "Soon afterwards Sāḷha was standing outside the gateway of his house repeatedly enquiring after Sundarīnandā:",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:8.2": "“Venerables, where’s Venerable Sundarīnandā?”",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:8.4": "The nun who was Sundarīnandā’s pupil told him: “She’s sick. I’ll bring her almsfood.”",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:8.7": "Sāḷha thought, “I invited the Order of nuns because of Sundarīnandā,”",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:8.9": "and after telling the people there to serve the meal to the Order of nuns, he left for the nuns’ dwelling place.",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:8.10": "Just then Sundarīnandā was standing outside the monastery gateway longing for Sāḷha.",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:8.11": "When she saw him coming, she entered the dwelling, put on her upper robe so that it covered her head, and lay down on her bed.",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:8.13": "Sāḷha approached her and said, “Venerable, what’s wrong with you? Why are you lying down?”",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:8.16": "“That’s what happens when one desires someone who doesn’t desire one in return.”",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:8.17": "“What do you mean that I don’t desire you?",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:8.18": "I just couldn’t find an opportunity to be intimate with you.”",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:8.19": "And both having lust, he made physical contact with Sundarīnandā.",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:9.1": "Just then a nun who was weak from old age and sick from traveling was lying down not far from Sundarīnandā.",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:9.2": "She saw how Sāḷha made physical contact with Sundarīnandā, both having lust.",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:9.3": "She complained and criticized her, “How could Venerable Sundarīnandā consent to a man making physical contact with her, when they both have lust?”",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:9.5": "That nun then told the nuns what had happened.",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:9.6": "The nuns of few desires who had a sense of conscience, who were contented, afraid of wrongdoing, and fond of the training, complained and criticized her,",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:9.7": "“How could Venerable Sundarīnandā consent to a man making physical contact with her, when they both have lust?”",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:9.8": "Then those nuns told the monks, and the monks of few desires who had a sense of conscience, who were contented, afraid of wrongdoing, and fond of the training, criticized her in the same way.",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:10.1": "After criticizing the nun Sundarīnandā in many ways, they told the Master.",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:10.2": "The Master then had the Order of monks assembled and questioned them,",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:10.3": "“Is it true, monks, that the nun Sundarīnandā is acting like this?”",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:10.4": "“It’s true, Master.”",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:10.5": "The Buddha criticized her,",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:10.6": "“It’s not suitable, monks, it’s not proper for the nun Sundarīnandā, it’s not worthy of an ascetic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done.",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:10.7": "“It’s not suitable, monks, it’s not proper for the nun Sundarīnandā, it’s not worthy of an ascetic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done.",

  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:10.9": "but it will hinder confidence in those without it, and it will cause some with confidence to change their minds.”",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:10.10": "Then the Master spoke in dispraise of being difficult to support and maintain, in dispraise of great desires, discontent, socializing, and laziness; but he spoke in praise in various ways of being easy to support and maintain, of fewness of wishes, contentment, self-effacement, ascetic practices, serenity, reduction in things, and of being energetic. After giving a teaching on what is right and proper, he addressed the monks:",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:10.11": "“Because of this, monks, I will lay down a training rule for the following ten reasons:",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:10.12": "for the well-being of the Order, for the comfort of the Order, for the restraint of bad nuns, for the ease of well-behaved nuns, for the restraint of corruptions in the present life, for avoiding corruptions in future lives, to give rise to confidence in those without it, to increase the confidence of those who have it, for the continuation of the true Teaching, and for supporting the training.",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:10.13": "And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule thus:",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:11.1": "‘If a lustful nun consents to a lustful man making physical contact with her, to touching her, to taking hold of her, to contacting her, or to squeezing her, anywhere below the collar bone but above the knees, she too is expelled and excluded from the community.
