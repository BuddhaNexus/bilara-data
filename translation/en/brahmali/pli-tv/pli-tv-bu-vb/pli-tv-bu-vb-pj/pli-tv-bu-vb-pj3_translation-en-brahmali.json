  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.2": "At that time the Master spoke to the monks in many ways about unattractiveness—",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.3": "he spoke in praise of unattractiveness,",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.4": "in praise of developing the mind in unattractiveness,",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.5": "and in praise of the attainment of unattractiveness.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.6": "The Master then addressed the monks,",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.7": "“Monks, I wish to go into solitary retreat for half a month.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.8": "No-one is to approach me except the one who brings me almsfood.”",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.9": "“Yes, Venerable Sir,” they replied, and no-one approached him except the one who brought him almsfood.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.10": "The monks thought, “The Master has talked in many ways about unattractiveness,”",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.11": "and they devoted themselves to the development of the mind in unattractiveness in its many different aspects.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.12": "As a consequence, they became troubled by their own bodies, ashamed of them, disgusted with them.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.13": "Just as a young woman or man—someone fond of adornments, who had just washed her hair—would be ashamed, humiliated, and disgusted if the carcase of a snake, a dog, or a man were hung around her neck,",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.14": "just so those monks were troubled by their own bodies. They took their own lives,",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.15": "took the lives of one another,",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.16": "and they approached Migalaṇḍika, the ascetic lookalike, and said,",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.18": "This bowl and these robe will be yours.”",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.19": "And hired for a bowl and robes, Migalaṇḍika killed many monks.",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.23": "Then, walking across the water, a god from the realm of the lord of death said to Migalaṇḍika,",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.24": "“Well done, superior man, you’re truly fortunate.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.25": "You’ve made much merit, because you’ve brought across those who hadn’t yet crossed.”",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.26": "And Migalaṇḍika thought,",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.27": "“So it seems that I’m fortunate and that I’ve made much merit.”",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.28": "He then went from dwelling to dwelling, from precincts to precincts, and said, “Who hasn’t crossed yet?",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.29": "Whom do I bring across?”",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.30": "The monks who still had sensual desire became fearful and terrified, with their hair standing on end.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.31": "Only those who were free from desires were unaffected.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.32": "Then, on a single day, Migalaṇḍika killed one monk, two monks, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, even sixty monks.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.2.1": "At the end of that half-month, the Master came out of seclusion and said to Venerable Ānanda,",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.2.2": "“Ānanda, why is the Order of monks so diminished?”",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.2.3": "Ānanda told him what had happened and added,",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.2.13": "“Venerable Sir, please give another instruction so that the Order of monks may become established in final knowledge.”",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.2.14": "“Well then, Ānanda, bring together in the assembly-hall all the monks who live near Vesālī.”",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.2.15": "“Yes.”",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.2.16": "When he had done so, he approached the Master",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.2.17": "and said,",
