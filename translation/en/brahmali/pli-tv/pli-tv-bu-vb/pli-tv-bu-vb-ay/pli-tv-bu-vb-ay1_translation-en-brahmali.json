  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.2": "At that time Venerable Udāyī was associating with and visiting a number of families in Sāvatthī.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.3": "One of those families had given their daughter in marriage to the son of another family.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.4": "Just then, after robing up in the morning, Venerable Udāyī took his bowl and robe and went to the first of those families.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.5": "When he arrived, he asked",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.10": "He then went there",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.11": "and again asked",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.12": "where the girl was.",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.18": "At sacrifices, festivals, and celebrations people would feed Visākhā first.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.19": "Just then she had been invited to the family that supported Venerable Udāyī.",
