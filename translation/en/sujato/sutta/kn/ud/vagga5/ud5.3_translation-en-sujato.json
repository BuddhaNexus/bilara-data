  "ud5.3:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. ",
  "ud5.3:1.3": "At that time in Rājagaha there was a leper called Suppabuddha. ",
  "ud5.3:1.4": "He was poor, destitute, and pitiful. ",
  "ud5.3:1.5": "Now, at that time the Buddha was teaching Dhamma, surrounded by a large assembly. ",
  "ud5.3:2.1": "Suppabuddha saw the crowd seated off in the distance",
  "ud5.3:2.2": "and thought, ",
  "ud5.3:2.3": "“Surely some variety of foods will be distributed there.",
  "ud5.3:2.4": "Why don’t I approach the crowd?",
  "ud5.3:2.5": "Hopefully I’ll get something to eat.”",
  "ud5.3:3.1": "So he approached the crowd",
  "ud5.3:3.2": "where he saw the Buddha teaching Dhamma, surrounded by a large assembly. ",
  "ud5.3:3.3": "When he saw this he thought, ",
  "ud5.3:3.4": "“There’s no food being distributed here.",
  "ud5.3:3.5": "The ascetic Gotama is teaching Dhamma in an assembly. ",
  "ud5.3:3.6": "Why don’t I also listen to the teaching?”",
  "ud5.3:3.7": "Right there he sat down to one side, thinking,",
  "ud5.3:3.8": "“I also will listen to the teaching.”",
  "ud5.3:4.1": "Then the Buddha focused on comprehending the minds of everyone in the Saṅgha, thinking, “Who here is capable of understanding the teaching?”",
  "ud5.3:4.2": "He saw Suppabuddha sitting in the assembly,",
  "ud5.3:4.3": "and thought, ",
  "ud5.3:4.4": "“He is capable of understanding the teaching.”",
  "ud5.3:4.5": "He gave a step by step talk especially for Suppabuddha",
  "ud5.3:4.6": "on giving, ethical conduct, and heaven. ",
  "ud5.3:4.7": "He explained the drawbacks of sensual pleasures, so sordid and corrupt, and the benefit of renunciation. ",
  "ud5.3:4.9": "When the Buddha knew that Suppabuddha’s mind was ready, supple, without hindrances, joyful, and confident, he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhas: ",
  "ud5.3:4.10": "suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. ",
  "ud5.3:4.11": "Just as a clean cloth rid of stains would properly absorb dye, ",
  "ud5.3:4.12": "in that very seat the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma in Suppabuddha: ",
  "ud5.3:4.13": "“Everything that has a beginning has an end.” ",
  "ud5.3:5.1": "Then Suppabuddha saw, attained, understood, and fathomed the Dhamma. He went beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and became self-assured and independent of others regarding the Teacher’s instructions. He rose from his seat and went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said:",
  "ud5.3:6.1": "“Excellent, sir! Excellent! ",
  "ud5.3:6.2": "As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways. ",
  "ud5.3:6.5": "I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. ",
  "ud5.3:6.6": "From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” ",
  "ud5.3:7.1": "After Suppabuddha had been educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired with a Dhamma talk by the Buddha, he got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha before leaving. ",
  "ud5.3:7.2": "But soon after Suppabuddha had left, a cow with a baby calf charged at him and took his life. ",
  "ud5.3:8.1": "Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said,",
  "ud5.3:8.3": "“The leper called Suppabuddha, after being educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired with a Dhamma talk by the Buddha, has passed away.",
  "ud5.3:8.4": "Where has he been reborn in his next life?” ",
  "ud5.3:9.1": "“Mendicants, Suppabuddha was astute. He practiced in line with the teachings, and did not trouble me about the teachings. ",
  "ud5.3:9.4": "With the ending of three fetters, Suppabuddha is a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.” ",
  "ud5.3:10.1": "When he said this, one of the mendicants said to the Buddha, ",
  "ud5.3:10.2": "“What is the cause, sir, what is the reason why Suppabuddha the leper was ",
  "ud5.3:10.3": "poor, destitute, and pitiful?”"
